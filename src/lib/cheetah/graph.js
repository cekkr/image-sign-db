// Thin, typed access to Cheetah's graph and associative-recall commands.
//
// The authority for every format here is the submodule's own handbook
// (cheetah/AGENTS.md) and its `ExecuteCommand` switch — this module only spells
// the commands, it does not restate their semantics.
//
// Three encoding rules the command family imposes, and the reason each one
// matters here:
//
//   1. `GRAPH_*` speaks `key=value` tokens split on **whitespace**
//      (cheetah/src/database.go → parseKeyValueArgs uses strings.Fields), so no
//      value may contain a space. Anything free-form — props, batch items —
//      travels base64. A filename with a space in it is the common case.
//   2. The split is on the **first** `=` (strings.Cut), so base64 padding is
//      safe inside a value.
//   3. `GRAPH_RECALL` accepts at most 32 seeds per call
//      (graphRecallMaxSeeds). Callers with more must batch and merge, which is
//      what `recallBatched` below does.
